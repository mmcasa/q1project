- Things you would do differently
- Thing that youâ€™re most proud of
- How would you refactor your code?

1- Solves your trivia problem and lack of knowledge
2-Brings in an api
3-Would have added boxes for categories, clues, title's, music and animations
4-Getting the APi to work!
5- I would run unit tests to make sure when I refactor the logic dosent get messed up in the process!
